# 📡 Digital Signal Processing with MATLAB

This project contains MATLAB scripts and resources for designing, simulating, and experimenting with digital filters. It is organized to support learning and research in digital signal processing (DSP).

## Folder Structure

- `mathlab_code/` – Contains MATLAB `.m` files for filter design and signal generation
  
- `DSP.ipynb` – A Jupyter notebook with filter experiments (likely using Python with MATLAB engine or NumPy/Scipy)
- `voice.wav` – Sample audio file for filter testing
- `violin_noise.wav` – Sample audio file for filter testing
- `violine_origional.wav` – Sample audio file for filter testing

- `README.md` – This file!
