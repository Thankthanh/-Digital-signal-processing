This project contains MATLAB scripts and resources for designing, simulating, and experimenting with digital filters. It is organized to support learning and research in digital signal processing (DSP).

## Folder Structure

- `mathlab_code/` – Contains MATLAB `.m` files for filter design and signal generation
  
- `ipynb` – A Jupyter notebook with filter experiments (likely using Python with MATLAB engine or NumPy/Scipy)
- `voice.wav` – Sample audio file for filter testing
- `violin_noise.wav` – Sample audio file for filter testing
- `violine_origional.wav` – Sample audio file for filter testing

- `README.md` – This file!
